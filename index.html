<p class="section">Short Bio</p>
<p>I received a Ph.D. degree in computer science from Xidian University, China, in 2011, before I conducted postdoctoral researches twice. Afterwards, I worked as a visiting scholar at Peking University and Tsinghua University from 2019 to 2021. Currently, I am an associate professor at Zhengzhou University, China, and a senior member of China Computer Federation (CCF). In 2018, I was awarded the honorary title of provincial young backbone teacher by the Department of education of Henan Province. I presided over 3 national research projects, and won 2 provincial first-class scientific awards. So far, I have authored 20 papers published in SCI journals, or Chinese journals in the list of class A of CCF ranking. My research interests span a diverse set of topics, such as formal methods, AI applications, information security, DNA computing, block chain and multimedia. </p>
